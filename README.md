## The Components of a Web Page

- When we visit a web page, our web browser makes a request to a web server. 
- This request is called a GET request, since we’re getting files from the server. 
- The server then sends back files that tell our browser how to render the page for us. 
- These files will typically include:
  ** HTML — the main content of the page.
  ** CSS — used to add styling to make the page look nicer.
  ** JS — Javascript files add interactivity to web pages.
  *** Images — image formats, such as JPG and PNG, allow web pages to show pictures.
